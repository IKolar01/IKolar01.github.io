                <p>This work is a conceptual piece that responds to the prompt, "What would a poster for a local event you are putting on look like?" The project focuses on two main elements: the content of the event and how a poster can effectively communicate what it showcases.</p>
                <img src="/documents/MCSE/MCSE poster.png" alt="">
                <p>To begin, I had to decide on the event and its content. After much consideration, I settled on an exhibition that highlights fashion, art, and furniture styles from the 40s, 50s, and 60s. The exhibition would be divided into three main areas: furniture and interior decoration, artwork, and fashion. Upon entering the gallery, visitors would be greeted with representations of common spaces such as restaurants, kitchens, and living rooms to showcase the furniture and interior decoration style from the era. Next, they would view artwork from the time. Finally, visitors would make their way to the fashion section, where mannequins dressed in authentic clothes would represent the culture of the era, particularly the post war, Tiki, and British Mod styles. Overall, the exhibition would provide an immersive experience that captures the essence of the period.</p>

                <p>Once I was finished with the exhibition concept, I began designing the poster. To kick off the design process, I started with a sketching exercise to explore various possibilities and push the boundaries of what could work. From the 50+ sketches I produced, I selected the top 3 that served as the main inspiration for the final layout of the typography. The midcentury modern style and the 2D color block style from the era served as major influences for the poster's design. I aimed to maintain a modern color palette while staying true to the essence of the time period. These design choices were integral in creating a cohesive and effective poster that would draw the attention of the intended audience.</p>

                <p>I created the poster design using Adobe Illustrator software, with the intention of screen-printing it for a unique look. However, I also kept in mind the possibility of mass-producing it through digital printing. Unfortunately, I was unable to produce a screen-printed version due to limitations in time and resources.</p>
