          <h1>House of Billards Branding</h1>
          <p>This branding project is a concept piece inspired by the real "House Of Billiards", a small pool hall and bar in California. I wanted to give the brand a new look while maintaining the core ideals of the company.
             Originally, they did not have much of a brand at all, and the branding they did have was inconsistant. They had two different logos that they did not use outside of their social media profile picture and pint glasses in the bar.
             Their previous brand didn't seem to be tailored to attracting new patrons, which is a major missed opportunity, because they have the potential to be a popular spot for the 20-40 year old demographic.
            House Of Billiards wants to convey a comfortable, warm, and vintage pool hall enviroment, but nothing besides the space itself gives that feeling, so the object of the rebrand was to allow the brand to send the message "Hey, we have a nice place to hang out! Come have a beer and play some pool!"
        </p>
        <p>My process began with looking at the interior design of the bar itself. Their decoration is inspired by late Antebellum era New Orleans design, along with the exterior also having similar architecture to this style.
            The combination of New Orleans and the name "House Of Billiards" made me think about the song "House of the Rising Sun" which tells a story set in New Orleans. I started to think about sun imagery that would fit with the existing decorations.
        My final design's art style takes insperation from an art style used by the restraunt chain "McMenamins" which uses a style they call "historical surrealism". From there, I chose the colors based on the real world. I got the yellow from the 1 billiard ball, and the red comes from the sunrise, but tweeked to make it more surreal.
        The fonts chosen were meant to invoke the feel of hand-painted signs from the late Antebellum period.
    </p>
        <p>In the end, I built a brand for House Of Billiards that successfully communicates a welcoming enviroment.
