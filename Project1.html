          <h1>House of Billards Branding</h1>
          <p>This branding project is a concept piece inspired by the real "House Of Billiards", a small pool hall and bar in California. I wanted to give the brand a new look while maintaining the core ideals of the company.
             Originally, they did not have much of a brand at all, and the branding they did have was inconsistant. They had two different logos that they did not use outside of their social media profile picture and pint glasses in the bar.
             Their previous brand didn't seem to be tailored to attracting new patrons, which is a major missed opportunity, because they have the potential to be a popular spot for the 20-40 year old demographic.
            House Of Billiards wants to convey a comfortable, warm, and vintage pool hall enviroment, but nothing besides the space itself gives that feeling, so the object of the rebrand was to allow the brand to send the message "Hey, we have a nice place to hang out! Come have a beer and play some pool!"
