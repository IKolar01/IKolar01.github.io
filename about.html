            <p>Hey, Im Ian, and I'm a recent graduate in design from Western Washington University. I am passionate about all things design and I want to use that passion to help you with your design needs.
            As a designer, I am committed to producing high-quality work that not only meets your needs but also communicates a meaningful message. I believe that good design is not just about aesthetics but also about solving problems and improving user experiences. 
            I have developed a strong foundation in design principals and software, such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign, After Effects, and Figma, as well as some knowledge in HTML and CSS. I also have experience with various types of printing, including screenprinting. Along with that, I have some knowledge in GIS and cartography. My design interests extend to branding, packaging, along with some web design.</p>
