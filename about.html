            <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>Hey, Im Ian, and I'm a design student at Western Washington University. I am passionate about all things design and I am working towards my design bachalor of arts degree, and I will graduate in 2024.
            As a designer, I am committed to producing high-quality work that not only meets client needs but also communicates a meaningful message. I believe that good design is not just about aesthetics but also about solving problems and improving user experiences. 
            I have developed a strong foundation in design principals and software, such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign, After Effects, and Figma, as well as some knowledge in HTML and CSS. I also have experience with varous types of printing, including screenprinting. My design intrests extend to branding, packaging, along with some web design.</p>
