                            Hi, Im Ian, I am a 3rd year student at WWU majoring in Design. My favorite type of design is branding and layout, and I am most comfortable using Photoshop, Illustrator, and Indesign, but I can use AfterEffects and Premiere proficiantly. I have been doing design since
                            my Sophomore year of highschool. Before I decided to persue design, I was interested in Engineering and was planning on doing that. I once entered a sock design compitition, and out of about 10,000 submissions, I came in 24th place. I put some of my designs on Redbubble, but those are usually things I spent a maximum of like 20 minutes on. I find branding the most 
                            fun because to me, it doesn't really feel like art, it's more like a logic puzzle. I have to find the most creative way to convey a message. It almost feels like a game for me. Before choosing design as my potential future, I was into architecture and engineering, so 
                            I think those come into play while Im working on something.
                        </p>
