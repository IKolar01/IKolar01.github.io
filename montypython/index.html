                        Monty Python was born in May 1969, at the Light of Kashmir tandoori restaurant in Hampstead, where five Brits (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin) and an American (animator Terry Gilliam) 
                        first sat down <img src="images/montyp1.jpeg"> to discuss working together on a new BBC comedy series. Since 1966, five of the Pythons-to-be had all been writing and performing in numerous eclectic comedy shows, including ‘The Frost Report’, ‘At Last the 1948 Show’ and ‘Do Not Adjust Your 
                        Set’ – the last of which featured Gilliam’s highly-original cut-out animations, which would become integral to Monty Python’s unique style. 
                        Terry Jones and Michael Palin met at Oxford University, where they performed together with the Oxford Revue. Graham Chapman and John Cleese met at Cambridge University. Eric Idle was also at Cambridge,
                        but started a year after Chapman and Cleese. In 1969, Jones and Palin Wrote and starred in “The Complete and Utter History of Britain”, a short-lived series about the various periods of British History. Though the show didn’t 
                        last, Cleese was a fan and wanted to find a way to work with Palin and Jones. What happened next made history.

                                The team all agreed that they wanted to overturn the conventions of traditional sketch comedy – sketches with a beginning, middle and end,
                                 punchlines, blackouts, and topical gags. Their approach to comedy would be unpredictable, aggressive and irreverent, each episode a thirty-minute 
                                 stream-of-consciousness, reflecting the revolutionary times of the late ‘60s. Coinciding with the arrival of colour television, ‘Monty Python’s 
                                 Flying Circus’ made its debut on BBC1 on October 5, 1969, at 10:55 p.m. on a Sunday night, sandwiched between ‘Omnibus’ and the weather. The Pythons’ 
                                 gleefully deconstructed the very medium of television; there were parodies of documentaries, game shows, commercials and chat-show interviews. But they 
                                 also frequently subverted the very grammar of television itself – for example, the opening titles might appear halfway through an episode, or the end title 
                                 crawl would unspool at the very beginning. The iconic BBC globe was regularly hijacked, with voice-over announcers heard eating or engaged in tortured personal 
                                 crises in the background. Over the next few years the show received three BAFTA awards, including Best Light Entertainment Programme, and two special awards for 
                                 its writing–performance, and for Gilliam's graphics. The series soon gained acclaim outside the U.K., with a specially-made episode receiving the<img src="images/montyp2.jpeg">  Silver Rose of 
                                 Montreux, and an invitation to make a program for German television, titled ‘Monty Python’s Fliegender Zirkus’. Performed by the cast in German, it was so 
                                 well-received, it led to the Python team returning in 1972 to record a second special (this time in English).In addition to 45 episodes of ‘Flying Circus’, 
                                 the Pythons produced inventive work in other media (including record albums and books). They both mined their prodigious television output and created new 
                                 material that was as subversive as their TV scripts.

                                        The team's ‘Big Red Book’ (published, with a blue cover, in 1971) sold out its initial print run within a week. Its follow-up, ‘The Brand New Monty 
                                        Python Book’, amassed advance sales of over 100,000. At the same time they also released a string of hugely-popular vinyl albums, masterfully seizing 
                                        the full imaginative potential of the audio medium. (‘Matching Tie and Handkerchief’ was the first three-sided record album). It is impossible to 
                                        overestimate the importance of these items. <img src="images/montyp3.jpg" alt=""class=gray>In the days before home video, it was through their books and records that fans 
                                        were able to relive and memorise their favourite Python moments. In 1971 the Pythons' first film, ‘And Now for Something Completely Different’, was produced as a means of 
                                         introducing the group to American audiences, particularly the college crowd. The movie, a remounted collection of sketches, received a surprisingly
                                          strong response in England, despite the familiarity of the material from the original TV broadcasts. The Pythons received a similarly strong welcome
                                           when they performed live on stage, on tours of England and Canada, and finally at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Sparked by FM radio broadcasts
                                            of the Pythons' records, imports of the books and clips shown on TV, interest in the group grew in the United States until, in 1974, public television
                                             station KERA-TV in Dallas, Texas, became the first to air ‘Monty Python's Flying Circus’. Other PBS stations followed suit, providing an eager fan base 
                                             for the group's second movies, released in early 1975. The group had wanted to further explore the creative opportunities of feature films. Just as 
                                             production of the TV series was winding down (Cleese had announced his intention to withdraw from the show), they shot ‘Monty Python and the Holy Grail’. 
                                             A hilarious skewering of the Arthurian legend, it was directed by Jones and Gilliam, its low budget funded by a roll call of rock stars.It was a hit on both sides 
                                             of the Atlantic. The Pythons consolidated their status as comedy stars with a series of sold–out shows at New York’s City Center in 1976.The ‘70s ended with the Pythons
                                              regrouping for what many consider their most accomplished work, the mock-Biblical epic, ‘Life of Brian’. The film attracted controversy even before the cameras started 
                                              rolling, when its original producers objected to the film’s subject matter and withdrew funding, prompting former Beatle George Harrison to personally bankroll the production.
                                            It became a box office smash, despite protests from evangelicals and countless local authorities worldwide banning its screening. The 1980s saw the group begin to wind down, 
                                            with a lap of victory at the Hollywood Bowl (recorded and released as a concert film), the bestselling ‘Contractual Obligation Album’, and in 1983 a final cinema outing with 
                                            ‘The Meaning of Life’, a dark, ribald symphony of excess and meditation on mortality.

                                    Some things in life are bad. They can really make you mad. Other things just make you swear and curse. When you're chewing on life's gristle,
                                    Don't grumble, give a whistle And this'll help things turn out for the best. And Always look on the bright side of life
                                    Always look on the light side of life.
                                    If life seems jolly rotten,
                                    There's something you've forgotten,
                                    And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
                                    When you're feeling in the dumps,
                                    Don't be silly chumps,
                                    Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
                                    And
                                    Always look on the bright side of life,
                                    (Come on)
                                    Always look on the right side of life.
                                    For life is quite absurd
                                    And death's the final word.
                                    You must always face the curtain with a bow.
                                    Forget about your sin,
                                    Give the audience a grin,
                                    Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow.
                                    So always look on the bright side of death.
                                    A just before you draw your terminal breath.
                                    Life's a piece of shit,
                                    When you look at it.
                                    Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true.
                                    You'll see it's all a show.
                                    Keep 'em laughin' as you go.
                                    Just remember that the last laugh is on you
                                    And
                                    Always look on the bright side of life.
