            <h2>Discogs <span>Redesign</span></h2>
            <p>For my Discogs redesign project, I identified the primary issues of the website were usability and visual design. My research showed that the ease of use was the most pressing concern, as the 
                website was not user-friendly, and it took considerable time and effort to make a purchase. Moreover, the website looked unprofessional, which made it seem untrustworthy to users. 
                To resolve the usability problem, I combined some pages and simplified the shop page's information. I also improved filters to make them more helpful. For the visual design issue, I used the
                 main menu as a point of reference and revamped the rest of the pages to have a more welcoming and trustworthy appearance. Additionally, I added a new recommendation page to enhance the user 
                 experience. The result is a more usable and visually appealing Discogs website that helps users quickly and easily find the records they want.</p>
